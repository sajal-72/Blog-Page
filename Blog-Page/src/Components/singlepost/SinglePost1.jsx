          Thomas Peter Odell, or more commonly known by his stage name as Tom Odell, is an British singer and song writer that has been preforming since 2012 and is considered one of today’s most famous Indie Pop artists and an usher of the Indie Pop craze that was prominent in the early 2000s and much of the 2010s.
          Tom Odell was born in Chichester, West Sussex, England to middle class family with an airline pilot as a father and a primary school teacher as a mother; he also has one older sister. Not much is known about Tom’s early childhood because of his shy and private personality, although he does occasionally share some of his early experiences with music. From Brainily Quotes, he states, “When I was around 13 or 14, I started getting really into songwriting. And one day, I was rooting through my mum’s old tapes and records, and I found ‘Grace’ by Jeff Buckley. I remember so vividly the first time I put it on. It blew my mind: his voice, the way he could play the guitar. I must have listened to the album over and over for weeks.” Throughout many interviews, he implies that he had a very normal and average childhood, but although he played music, he did so secretively. It wasn’t until he started to grow into adulthood that he decided to immerse himself into the music world and find his way out of the shadows and onto the stage. But even though many people see him as a talented musician, he has insisted that he was not a particularly gifted child. He says, “Singing didn’t really come naturally to me, I don’t think. I had to really work at it. I just kept singing.”
